# Pre-Session Practice – Fusemachines AI Fellowship

This repository contains my personal Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for practicing key concepts from the **pre-session content** of selected weeks in the 24-week **Fusemachines AI Fellowship**.

Each notebook is focused on reinforcing foundational knowledge—such as Python, mathematics, software engineering, and data tools—through hands-on coding and experimentation.


## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen concepts before live sessions through practical exercises  
- Build fluency in core tools used throughout the fellowship (Python, SQL, FastAPI, etc.)  
- Maintain a structured archive of self-driven learning  
- Share reproducible examples and notes that others can benefit from


## 📘 Notes on Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific week and contains:
  - A practice notebook
  - A short `README.md` summarizing the focus and concepts covered
- **Not all weeks are included** — only those where meaningful practice was required or beneficial  
  (e.g., concept-heavy weeks may have no separate practice folder)


## 🔄 Weekly Updates

This repository will be updated progressively as the fellowship continues.  
The content reflects personal understanding, trial-and-error, and focused skill development.
